# Ticket_Tracker_App
Welcome to the Ticket Tracker Prototype repository! This project was all about creating a working prototype, showcasing the implementation of a simple ticket-tracking system using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, with data persistence achieved through local storage. This prototype lays the foundation for a future full-stack application, where additional features and functionalities will be incorporated.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, Local Storage

## Features:


## Lessons Learned:
**Local Storage Limitations:** Utilizing local storage for data persistence is convenient for prototyping but has limitations, such as security concerns and size restrictions. In the full-stack version, server-side storage and database solutions will be explored for better data management.

**User Experience Considerations:** Developing a user-friendly interface is crucial for effective interaction. Future iterations will focus on improving the overall user experience, including responsive design for various screen sizes and accessibility considerations.

**Scalability:** As the project evolves into a full-stack application, scalability becomes a significant consideration. Architectural decisions will be made with scalability in mind to handle potential increases in data volume and user activity.

## Future Plans:
This prototype is the first step towards developing a robust full-stack ticket tracking application. Future enhancements will include server-side functionalities, user authentication, and expanded collaboration features.


## Update:
